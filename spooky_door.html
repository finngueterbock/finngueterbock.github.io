                I wasn't looking for a fight as I walked down barry road<br>
                I was minding my own business, looking at my toes<br>
                And then this cat starts fucking meowing at me<br>
                But I couldn't tell where from<br>
                And I read that cats only meow when they want people's attention<br>
                <br>
                I'm a person, I thought. So I had a look around<br>
                <br>
                There he was, on a windowsill a floor up<br>
                How the fuck did he get up there then<br>
                And why won't he shut up<br>
                So I go over and see what he wants<br>
                <br>
                Says he just wants a hand getting down if that's alright<br>
                No problem mate, come here, I'll catch you<br>
                And he walks over to me, ready to jump<br>
                Then he just rolls back into the open window<br>
                Closes it behind him<br>
                <br>
                1 nil to the cat I guess. I've been had.<br>
                He's not even got thumbs
